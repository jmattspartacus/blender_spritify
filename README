Spritify V6.1
About:
When an animation render is complete, all of the frames in the animation are
compiled into a single spritesheet usable for sprite-based games.

There is a Spritify panel in Render Properties where you configure some of the
attributes of the sprite sheet as well as enable/disable the ability to
automatically generate a sprite sheet each time an animation render completes.

As of version 0.4.0, Spritify will also optionally generate an animated GIF.

As of V6.1, the choice to choose the number of rows and columns is available through the render options.

Requirements:
ImageMagick, a free, open source command line image manipulation software, downloadable from 
https://imagemagick.org/index.php
On installation, choose Install Legacy Utilities

Blender 2.8x, versions of blender earlier than 2.8 are supported by fweeb's original version.

Installation:
1. Install ImageMagick as described above, if you've already done that, go to the next step.
2. Download and unzip to a convenient location on your machine
3. Open blender 2.8x
4. Under edit, choose preferences, then Add-ons
5. At the top, choose install, then navigate to the script, select it and click install add-on

Note, these instructions apply to windows, but may not apply to mac/linux/centos/etc

Usage:
1. Prepare the animation(s) you wish to create sprites for
2. Render animation
3. By default the spritesheet will be saved to the render output directory, as 'sprites.png'

Bug Reporting:
Please leave a description of your issue, along with some details to reproduce in an issue, as time permits I will verify and try to fix issues. 
If you manage to fix it, you may submit a pull request and I will evaluate the changes and merge them if they do not break anything else.

Known Issues:
Windows x64, on finalizing spritesheet generation, the error
```
